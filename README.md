Here's a step-by-step procedure that you can present to your manager:

1. Identify CIS Tables:

Retrieve all the CIS (Customer Information System) tables from the test database.



2. API Query for Notepad CSS and ODS:

For each CIS table, query the API to fetch the Notepad CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and ODS (Open Document Spreadsheet) for that CIS.



3. Connect to Database:

After retrieving the necessary data from the API, connect to the respective database tables that correspond to each CIS.



4. Fetch Notepad Entries from DB:

For each CIS, fetch the Notepad entries from the database tables and compare them with the data obtained from the API.



5. Attribute Comparison:

Loop through all the attributes (fields) of the Notepad entries fetched from both the database and the API.

Compare each attribute for discrepancies.



6. Detect Changes:

If any changes or mismatches are found during the comparison, record them.



7. Store Differences in an Array:

Create an array to store the differences observed between the database and the API responses.



8. Update the Results Table:

If the comparison is successful (no mismatches), set apiflag1, apiflag2, and apiflag3 to 1 in the results table.

If there are any mismatches, set the flags to 2, and store the differences in the CLOB (Character Large Object) column of the results table.



9. Repeat for All CIS:

Repeat the above steps for each CIS table, ensuring that all records are checked and discrepancies are recorded.



10. Final Output:

After completing all comparisons, the results table will contain the success or failure flags and any differences in the CLOB column for further review.




This approach should be clear and manageable for you to explain to your manager.
